# Android Studio for beginners, Part 1: Installation and setup
For some years now it's been clear that Android is a force to be reckoned with in the mobile OS landscape. This Java-based technology has sparked a new gold rush, with programmers competing to make money from their mobile apps.<br>
To be successful, Android developers need a good grasp of the Java language (or Kotlin), Android APIs, and Android application architecture. It's also important to use an appropriate and effective development environment. For many years, Eclipse IDE with the ADT plugin was the preferred platform for Android development. Today, it's Android Studio.<br>
In this blog, I'll briefly introduce the Android development platform, then show you how to download, install, and run the software. <br>
## Get started with Android Studio
Android Studio is Google's officially supported IDE for developing Android apps. This IDE is based on IntelliJ IDEA, which offers a powerful code editor and developer tools. Android Studio 3.6.1 includes the following features:<br>
<li>
<ul>A flexible Gradle-based build system</ul>

Instant Run to push changes to your running app without building a new APK
Code templates and GitHub integration to help you build common app features and import sample code
Extensive testing tools and frameworks
Lint tools to help you catch performance, usability, version compatibility, and other problems
